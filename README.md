# Breast Cancer Classification

## Introduction
This script performs binary classification on the breast cancer dataset using logistic regression. It includes functions for loading the data, cleaning it, visualizing it, analyzing it, preparing it for modeling, and training a logistic regression model.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```git clone <repository_url>```
   ```cd <repository_name>```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  ```python -m venv env```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
- **Windows**:
  ```
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib```
5. Run the script:
   ```python3 testing.py```

## Script Functionality
- **load_data**: Loads the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn.
- **clean_data**: Cleans the loaded data (not necessary for this dataset).
- **visualize_data**: Visualizes the features of the breast cancer dataset.
- **analyze_data**: Performs analysis on the breast cancer dataset, such as summary statistics.
- **prepare_data**: Prepares the data by splitting it into features and target variable.
- **train_model**: Trains a logistic regression model and evaluates its accuracy.

The script first loads the breast cancer dataset, then visualizes the data, analyzes it, prepares it for modeling, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its accuracy. The accuracy of the trained model is printed to the console.
